Subscriber Wizard: Fixed issue where SQN (Sequence Number) was left NULL.

EIR Support: Added initial support for Equipment Identity Register.

OAM Deregistration on Disable: When a subscriber is changed to disabled and Save is clicked, the OAM Deregister API is triggered for that IMSI â€” effectively removing the device from the network.

Resolved issue where clicking "Add" after editing a record would reopen the last edited entry instead of a blank form.
